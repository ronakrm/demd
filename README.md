# Efficient Computation of d-Dimensional Earth Mover's Distance
This repository contains the implementation and experiments for ICLR 2023: Efficient Discrete Multi Marginal Optimal Transport Regularization.
Each folder corresponds to a unique experiment in the main paper, and each folder contains the corresponding version of our DEMD codebase.
For current plug-and-play, check out the `demd` folder within, and particularly `demdLoss.py`, `DEMDLayer.py`, and `demdFunc.py`.
